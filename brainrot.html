        <p>In the beginning, TOPG was like, "Skibidi dop dop dop yes yes!" and created the heavens and the earth. The earth was low-key mid, totally giving low-vibrational energy, and darkness was vibing over the deep waters. The Spirit of TOPG was doing the Skibidi dance over the waters.

            TOPG said, "Skibidi bop, let there be light!" and bam, there was light. TOPG saw the light and said, "This is lit af!" He separated the light from the darkness, calling the light “day” and the darkness “night.” That was the first day, and TOPG was like, “Skibidi day one, complete.”
            
            Then TOPG said, "Let’s make a sky to separate the waters," and so He did, creating the ultimate Skibidi backdrop. TOPG called the sky “Heaven,” and it was totally Gucci. Evening came, then morning—the second day.
            
            TOPG said, "Skibidi bop, let the waters under the sky gather to one place so dry ground can appear," and it happened. TOPG called the dry ground “land” and the gathered waters “seas.” He saw it was no cap good.
            
            TOPG said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds," and it was so. The land started sprouting, and TOPG saw it was low-key fire. That was the third day.
            
            Then TOPG said, "Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night and mark the seasons, days, and years!" So He made the sun for the day and the moon for the night, plus all the stars. Skibidi stars everywhere. TOPG set them in the sky to shine on the earth and rule over the day and night. And TOPG saw it was skibidi good. That was the fourth day.
            
            TOPG said, "Let the waters swarm with living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the sky!" So He created all kinds of sea creatures and every bird, and they were skibidi cool. TOPG blessed them, saying, "Skibidi be fruitful and multiply, fill the seas and the skies!" That was the fifth day.
            
            TOPG said, "Let the land produce living creatures: animals, livestock, and wild animals!" And it happened, all kinds of animals appeared, and TOPG saw it was skibidi great.
            
            Then TOPG said, "Let’s make humans in our image to rule over all this!" So He created humans, making them total looksmaxxed legends with all the rizz. He gave them dominion over the fish, birds, and animals, and told them to skibidi rule over everything.
            
            TOPG blessed them and said, "Skibidi be fruitful and multiply! Fill the earth and take care of it." He gave them all the plants and fruits to eat, and the animals got the green plants. TOPG saw everything He made, and it was totally snatched, the GOAT of creations.
            
            That's how the world came to be, and it's been absolutely skibidi ever since!</p>
