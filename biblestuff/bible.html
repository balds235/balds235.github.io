      <h1>DEAD Welcome to My GOOFY AHH BIBLE (GAB) Translation DEAD</h1>
      <p>I am a Roman Catholic, if you have a problem with that then this is not meant for you. This is a project that I created for fun. </p>
      <p>I really am doing this for fun, I have no experience in this field, and have a very small understanding of latin, I am trying my best.</p>
      <p>please keep in mind this is just for fun!</p>
      
      <h3> this is kinda dead for now and will be picked up later</h3>
