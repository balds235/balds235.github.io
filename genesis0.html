      <h1>Genesis (GAB)</h1>
      <p>1:1 In the beginning God created heaven and earth.</p>
      <p>1:2 The earth was empty, and hollow darkness covered the face of the earth; the Holy Spirit moved the far over waters.</p>
      <p>1:3 And God spoke: Light be made. And light was true.</p>
      <p>1:4 The light was seen by God, and it was good: and he divided the light from the darkness.</p>
      <p>1:5 He named the light day, and dark night; there was dusk and dawn the next day.</p>
      <p>1:6 </p>
