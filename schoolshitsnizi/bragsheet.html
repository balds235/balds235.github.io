          <h2>Academic Strengths & Areas of Growth</h2>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Learning Fast: I am able to learn new concepts and information very quickly which allows me to adapt effectively to what scenario I am in.</li>
            <li>Essay Writing: I possess strong writing skills, enabling me to explain my ideas in a written form.</li>
            <li>Pressure: I am able to work well under tight deadlines and situations that are stressful.</li>

            <h3>Weaknesses and Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Literary Analysis: I can be described as almost illiterate when it comes to literary analysis. However, I have spent time reading books that are hard, and tried to break them down even if poorly. This effort has led me to improving upon my skills in this area.</li>
            <li>Time Management: I struggle with time management immensely, primarily being shown with extremely inconsistent study habits and severe procrastination. I have started fixing my time management skills by working on assignments through blocks, by setting a general goal for me to finish at least one section in a session. Alongside this, I have gotten more organized and focused as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li>Notes: I have always struggled to take notes, especially in an organized manner. I have been starting to try and take more organized notes, which have helped me study more effectively several of my classes.</li>

            <li>Severe Self Criticism: I am often hypercritical of myself, which leads to my confidence and self esteem to fall apart, leading to other problems. I have worked on this by getting others' input on my work, and taking into account their opinion when I evaluate my work.</li>

         <h2>How I Have Spent the Last 2 Summers</h2>
             <p>During the summer of 2024, I spent time with my family in Russia while independently studying for my AP Calculus AB and AP U.S. History exams. I spent a few hours every week reviewing online material and watching videos on the concepts I was learning, which helped me prepare for the upcoming school year.
                
    <br /><br /> 
    In the summer of 2025, I participated in the Youth Mental Health Academy, where I studied psychology and the brain with the Child Mind Institute. I received training in adolescent crisis response and conducted a research project focused on how immigration control policies affect undocumented children. The experience helped me strengthen my analytical, research, and communication skills.
