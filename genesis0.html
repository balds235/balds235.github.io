      <h1>Genesis (GAB)</h1>
      <p>1:1 In the beginning God created heaven and earth.</p>
      <p>1:2 The earth was empty, and hollow darkness covered the face of the earth; the Holy Spirit moved the far over waters.</p>
      <p>1:3 And God spoke: Light be made. And light was true.</p>
      <p>1:4 The light was seen by God, and it was good: and he divided the light from the darkness.</p>
      <p>1:5 He named the light day, and dark night; there was dusk and dawn the very next day.</p>
      <p>1:6 And God spoke: Let there be a support in the sea, let it divide the waters.</p>
      <p>1:7 And the support was created by God, dividing the waters under the support from the ones above, and it was so.</p>
      <p>1:8 God called the arid lands, Earth; and the congregation of waters, the sea. God saw it to be good.</p>
      <p>1:9 It was said by God: Congregate all the waters underneath heaven in one place: and let the arid land appear. And it was true.</p>
